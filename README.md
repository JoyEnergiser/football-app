# football-app
This is the app I was asked to write to demonstrate my flutter knowledge.

It pulls json from apis to return the top team with the most wins over the last 30 days.
It uses Provider and future builders for statemanagement.



**git clone https://github.com/JoyEnergiser/football-app.git**

assuming you have your IDE setup for debugging already with a device setup, open it on the newly created folder then 

**flutter pub get**

**Flutter run**


For the tests 

**flutter test**
