# football-app
This is the app I was asked to write to demonstrate my flutter knowledge.

It pulls json from apis to return the top team with the most wins over the last 30 days.
It uses Provider and future builders for statemanagement.





I have finished working on the football app.I know you asked me to do it with the bloc method but in the end I decided to go with the pattern I know being provider. I really enjoyed working on the app especially learning about test driven development it has really enlightned me to a new a way to develop! and dealing with null safety for the first time was a step I had been procrastinating on for far too long.

clone it to your local folder

**git clone https://github.com/JoyEnergiser/football-app.git**

I'm assuming you have your IDE setup for debugging already with a device setup, open it on the newly created folder then 

**flutter pub get**

**Flutter run**


For the tests 

**flutter test**
